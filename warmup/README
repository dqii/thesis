>> learning has my current code that i'm happy with
my best classifier to date can be found in ./learning_algs
use it through interface.ipynb
datasets to be used are found in ./dataset on local repository 
loss functions that can be used are found in algs.py

>> in the previous folder there is my old code in various stages
multiclass_linear_classifier.py and linear_classifier.py are my first attempts at classifiers and could probably be ignored
I tried to combine them with classifier.ipynb is the most general classifier I made

I played around with a synthetic data generator in test_data_generator
